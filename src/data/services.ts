        q: 'Will a whole-house surge protector protect against lightning?',

      {
        q: 'Do I still need power strip surge protectors?',
        a: 'Yes, for the best protection, use both. A whole-house protector handles large external surges. Point-of-use protectors (quality power strips) handle smaller surges and provide additional protection for sensitive electronics like computers and TVs.',

      {
        q: 'How long does a whole-house surge protector last?',
        a: 'Most whole-house surge protectors last 3 to 5 years, depending on the number and size of surges they absorb. Many units have an indicator light that shows when the device needs replacement.',
